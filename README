Hate Yourself
"I've tried 27 todo apps. This is the first one I actually use daily." - Satisfied User (probably)
TaskMaster Pro Demo (See it in action!)
Why This Exists

As a developer, I:
Need to track tasks
Hate complex apps
Want my data to actually persist
After getting frustrated with existing options, I built TaskMaster Pro - a no-BS todo app that:
Works offline
Looks good
Doesn't have 300 hidden features
Actually gets out of your way

✨ Key Features
Feature	Why It Matters
One-click task creation	Stop wasting time in modal hell
Real persistence	localStorage + backup options coming soon
Meaningful progress tracking	Not just another useless progress bar
Actual dark mode	Not that grayish nonsense other apps use
Keyboard shortcuts	Because mice are for casuals

🚀 Getting Started

Option 1: Use It Now
Live Demo (GitHub Pages)

Option 2: Local Setup
bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskmaster-pro.git

# Open it (no build step!)
open index.html
System Requirements:

A modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)

2MB of disk space (yes, it's that small)

🎮 Interactive Demo
javascript
// Try these in your console!
addTask("Finish README", {priority: "high"}); // Adds a new task
completeTask(0); // Checks off first task
toggleDarkMode(); // Because why not
